# RedWineProject

The RedWineProject explores the physicochemical properties of red wine and their impact on quality ratings. Utilizing a dataset from P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis, this project performs statistical analyses and visualizes trends to understand how different factors contribute to the sensory experience of red wine.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset focuses on the "Vinho Verde" wine variant from Portugal, excluding details such as grape types, brand, or price. It tracks several physicochemical properties including acidity levels, sugar content, chloride levels, sulfur dioxide content, density, pH, sulfates, alcohol percentage, and expert quality ratings.

## Project Components

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Standardizes column names and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and range for each physicochemical property.
- **Data Visualization:** Creates scatter plots to illustrate relationships between different properties and wine quality.

## Key Insights

- **Density vs Alcohol:** Investigates the inverse relationship between density and alcohol content, highlighting its influence on wine quality.
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide vs Total Sulfur Dioxide:** Examines the proportional relationship between free and total sulfur dioxide content.
- **Residual Sugar vs Density:** Explores how residual sugar levels relate to wine density.
- **pH vs Alcohol:** Analyzes the pH levels in relation to alcohol content and their collective impact on wine quality.
