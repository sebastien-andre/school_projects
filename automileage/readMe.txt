driver.py lets you choose a date and perform some calculations with things like adding days or comparing if a day comes before or after another date. Also can calculate distance between dates.

AutoMileageAnalysis.py has you input a .dat file with information about a car and days gas was filled up. This also uses Date.py to output a nice table of money spent, gallons, miles driven, days between fills, and mpg.
