# Calendar Display Project

This Python script, `cal.py`, is designed to display the calendar for a specific month and year, provided by the user through command-line arguments. Created by Sebastien Lee for the CSC 1301 Project 1, this simple yet effective tool utilizes Python's built-in `calendar` module to generate and print the calendar in a traditional format.

## Features

- **Custom Calendar Display:** Generates a calendar for any given month and year, displaying it in a traditional format with days aligned under the appropriate weekdays.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Allows users to specify the month and year for the calendar directly through command-line arguments, offering flexibility and ease of use.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to catch and print errors, enhancing user experience by providing clear feedback in case of incorrect input.

## Usage

```bash
python cal.py [month] [year]
