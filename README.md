# School Projects - Intro to Computer Science

This repository contains a collection of projects developed during my introductory courses in computer science. These projects cover a wide range of topics, from data manipulation and analysis to simulations of complex systems like Turing Machines. Each project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques using Python.

## Projects Overview

- **RedWineProject:** Analyzes the physicochemical properties of red wine and their impact on quality ratings, using statistical methods and data visualization to explore the dataset provided by P. Cortez et al.
- **Date and Auto Mileage Analysis Tools:** A set of scripts for managing dates and analyzing automobile mileage data.
- **Caesar's Cipher Encoder and Decoder:** Implements Caesar's Cipher for encoding and decoding messages, showcasing basic cryptographic techniques.
- **Calendar Display Project:** Generates and displays a calendar for a specified month and year, illustrating date manipulation.
- **VoteScheme:** Includes two scripts for simulating different voting schemes - simple vote counting and ranked-choice voting.
- **Turing Machine:** Simulates a Turing Machine.
- **Students Courses Classes Management System:** Manages courses, students, and their grades, illustrating data management and object-oriented programming principles.
